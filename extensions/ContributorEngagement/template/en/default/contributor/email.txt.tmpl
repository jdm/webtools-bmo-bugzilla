Congratulations on having your first patch approved, and thank you for your
contribution to Mozilla.

The next step is to get the patch actually checked in to our repository. There
are two parts to this - the patch must be formatted correctly, and the bug needs
to be marked as ready for checkin.

For more information about formatting the patch, check out the links titled
"It has a correctly formatted author name" and "It has a correctly formatted commit message"
in this post:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mercurial_FAQ#How_can_I_generate_a_patch_for_somebody_else_to_check-in_for_me.3F

For more information about marking the bug for checkin, see this post:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/How_to_Submit_a_Patch#Getting_the_patch_checked_into_the_tree

While you are going through those final steps, if you're looking for a new
project to take on, have a look at our list of 'mentored' [% terms.bugs %] ([% terms.bugs %] where
someone is specifically available to help you):

Alternatively, you could join us on our IRC chat server in the #introduction
channel and ask for suggestions about what would be a good [% terms.bugs %] to work on.

If you haven't done so already, this is also a good time to sign up to the
Mozilla Contributor Directory and create a profile for yourself. Doing this
will give you access to community members' profiles so you can reach out and
connect with other Mozillians. You will need someone to 'vouch for' your
profile; if you don't know any other Mozillians well, why not contact the
person who approved your patch?

The directory is here:

Thanks again for your help :-)
